    "In this sample use case, we have some students' grades regarding four disciplines (features, variables). Instead of clustering analysis, where we directly join similar observations (students) into similar groups (clusters) based on the original features, we now want to do a factorial analysis, using PCA (Principal Component Analysis), in order to join all features (disciplines) into orthogonal (fewer) components (axes) — two or three at most — with different specific weights of each discipline represented in each component, and different factorial scores of each observation on those new axes, in order to maximize the variance (of factorial scores), that is, the magnitude of representation of the original observations in the new components, discarding the least representative ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two or three components will contain most of the representation of the original observations, even if we had tens of variables (dimensions) at first. The correlation of representation of each original variable in each component is called loadings, and the loss of each original variable in the components, after we discard the least representative ones, is called communalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "All this is done so that we can ultimately reduce the observations’ dimensionality to fewer dimensions (axes) and, instead of four disciplines (features, variables), as originally in this case, have maybe only two components (axes) to analyze the data with (including most of the original variables and data in them).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then rank the observations based on a weighted sum of factorial scores and relative variance of each component, perform a clustering analysis based on fewer dimensions, or even do a regression analysis with better predictivity, if that is the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the main utilities of such a machine learning technique are: dimensionality (features, variables) reduction, summarization, revealing of hidden constructs or latent dimensions (difficult to perceive in the original variables), handling of multicollinearity into orthogonal independent components (useful for regression, clustering, etc.), better visualization and analysis of the data — especially when you have lots of original variables — ranking and scoring of the observations, data cleaning (discarding noise and keeping signal), and feature engineering improvements when training machine learning models (faster training, less overfitting, better generalization).\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used in each phase of the method below is always the standardized Z-score data, calculated internally at each step. For such data, we have a Pearson correlation matrix, on which a determinant calculation is applied and, from its extracted polynomial equation, we obtain the roots, which in turn are the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix and represent the absolute variance intrinsic to each component (measurement of how spread out the projected values - scores - are at each eigen axis).\n",
    "\n",
    "The sum of the eigenvalues equals the number of original variables, so the relative variance is the absolute eigenvalue explained by each respective component divided by the total absolute variance (the number of original variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the variances of each component, we also have the eigenvector values (coefficients) of each component (for each original variable), which contain the weights of each original variable in each component. The loadings, which are the correlations of each variable with each component, are the product of the weight (coefficient) of each original variable (eigenvector values) and the square root of the absolute variance (eigenvalue) explained by each component.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sum of squares of the loadings of all variables for a component is the communality of that component. The first one or two components (three, at most) should have the highest possible loadings (and explained variance - eigenvalue), and thus the least loss of information (highest communalities) for each original variable represented in those components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, no matter how many variables we had originally, we can now visualize, analyze, and manipulate the data using only the main components (dimensions) obtained through this method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The eigenvector weights (coefficients) of each original variable in each component, in turn, give an understanding of which variables are most represented in each component - all original variables are represented in all components, but with different proportions, some more, others less. Meanwhile, the factorial (or component) scores for each observation — obtained when the Z-score values are applied to each component equation and multiplied by the weights of each variable — give us the relative position of those observations when distributed through each component axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, variance (of factorial scores) means representativeness of data (at that eigen axis), while weights, loadings and communalities represent the statistical correlation of original features (variables) with the components. This kind of analysis does not measure or consider the real-world importance of any feature. The components, in turn, are derived features, that don't even exist in reality - they're abstract constructs, based on latent semantics combined with the semantics already present at the original features.\n",
    "\n",
    "For understanding PCA when performing factorial analysis, you should look for specific references that explain it better, with lots of graphs and animations, which is not the purpose of this Python notebook. Here, we simply aim to demonstrate how to apply the technique using Python-specific libraries, which, thankfully, avoids the need to perform extensive matrix and vector calculations, including solving high-degree polynomial equations (when finding the eigenvalues, eigenvectors and the other properties mentioned above)."
